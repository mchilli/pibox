# PiBox

PiBox is a music player for a local device, controlled over a rotary encoder with or
without a 16x2 lcd display, directly on a headless device or even over the network.

The project start early 2017 and with this I started learn to code python (thats the point
why there are some old comments in the main python script :innocent:).The idea behind was
to give my kids a device where they can listen to some audiobooks for childrens. So I buyed
a Raspberry Pi Zero, a rotary encoder, a 16x2 LCD display and build all together in a old
speaker that I still had in my basement.
